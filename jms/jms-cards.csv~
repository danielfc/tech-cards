"In JMS, there are two types of destinations: _______ and _______.","topics,queues"
"In the point-to-point model, messages are sent from producers to consumers via _______.","queues"

"Y/N - A given queue may have multiple receivers and many receivers may consume each message.","N"

"A durable subscription, on the other hand, guarantees that the consumer receives the message exactly ____.","once"
"Y/N - Even though JMS is inherently asynchronous, the JMS specification allows messages to be consumed in either of the following two ways: asynchronously and synchronously.","Y"
"With the asynchronous mode, the client must implement the <i>javax.jms.MessageListener</i> interface and overwrite the ________() method.","onMessage"
"With the synchronous mode, a subscriber or a receiver explicitly fetches the message from the destination by calling the _______() method of any MessageConsumer instance. This method can block until a message arrives or can time out if a message does not arrive within a specified time limit.","receive"
"Y/N - A JMS message consists of a header, properties, and a body.","Y"
"Y/N - A JMS message consists of a header and a body.","N"
"The JMS API supports two delivery modes for messages to specify whether or not the messages are lost if the JMS provider fails: <b>persistent and non-persistent.</b>",""
"Y/N - The persistent delivery mode, which is the default, instructs the JMS provider to take extra care to ensure that a message is not lost in transit in case of a JMS provider failure. A message sent with this delivery mode is logged to stable storage when it is sent.","Y"
"In the point-to-point (PTP) messaging domain, destinations are called _______; in the publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging domain, destinations are called _______.","queues,topics"
"A ____________ is the component a client uses to specify the target of messages it produces and the source of messages it consumes.","destination"
"A connection _________ object encapsulates a set of connection configuration parameters that have been defined by an administrator. A client uses it to create a connection with a JMS provider.","factory"
"A ________ is a single-threaded context for producing and consuming messages. You use them to create message producers, message consumers, and messages. They serialize the execution of message listeners and provide a transactional context with which to group a set of sends and receives into an atomic unit of work.","session"
"A message ________ is an object created by a session and is used for sending messages to a destination. The PTP form implements the <b>QueueSender</b> interface. The pub/sub form implements the <b>TopicPublisher</b> interface.","producer"
"A message _________ is an object created by a session and is used for receiving messages sent to a destination. It allows a JMS client to register interest in a destination with a JMS provider. The JMS provider manages the delivery of messages from a destination to the registered consumers of the destination. The PTP form of message consumer implements the <b>QueueReceiver</b> interface. The pub/sub form implements the <b>TopicSubscriber</b> interface.","consumer"
"JBoss AS has used different JMS implementations across its releases. Since JBoss AS 6.0, the default JMS provider is ________, which provides a multiprotocol, embeddable, very high performance and clusterable messaging system.","HornetQ"
"Y/N - It's possible to use the messaging subsystem by using the default standalone server.","N"
"Y/N - In order to use the messaging subsystem you have to start JBoss AS using a full profile, which includes the messaging subsystem.","Y"

"One of the most important aspects of message-driven beans is that they can consume and process messages ____________.","concurrently"
"Y/N - The MDB containers manage concurrency automatically, so the bean developer can focus on the business logic of processing the messages.","Y"
"The component interfaces are absent because the message-driven bean is not accessible via the Java ___ API; it responds only to asynchronous messages.","RMI"
