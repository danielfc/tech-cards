"When using a standard load balancer such as _______, you have to provide a static list of nodes that are used to spread the load. This is a very limiting factor, especially if you have to deliver upgrades to your configuration by adding or removing nodes or you simply need to upgrade releases used by single nodes. Besides this, using a flat cluster configuration can be tedious and prone to errors, especially if the number of cluster nodes is high.","mod_jk"

"What is the problem with flat large clusters? It's not scalable, the replication goes to each node. It's better to use an approach with domains to divide and conquer. In domain clusters, the replication is domain-specific. The downside is that if the domain runs out of nodes, the data session is lost.","Y"
