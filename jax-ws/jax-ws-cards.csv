"The __ _______ ________ ________, also known as WSDL, is the de facto standard for providing a description of a web service contract exposed to clients. In particular, a WSDL document describes a web service in terms of the operations that it provides, and the data types that each operation requires as inputs and can return in the form of results.","Web Service Description Language"
"Communication between the service provider and service consumer happens by means of XML messages that rely on the ____ specification.","SOAP"

"This development strategy involves creating a web service from a WSDL file.","top-down"
"The ___-_____ approach is likely to be used when creating web services from scratch.","top-down"
"This approach requires the WSDL file to be generated by the programming interfaces.","bottom-up"
"It is likely to be used when we have existing applications that we want to expose as web services.","bottom-up"
"Apache ___ is an open source web service framework that provides an easy-to-use, standard-based programming model for developing both SOAP and REST web services.","CXF"
"The Java ____________ for XML _________ (JAXB) provides a fast and convenient way to bind XML schemas and Java representations, making it easy for Java developers to incorporate XML data and process functions in Java applications","Architecture, Binding"
"____ provides methods for unmarshalling XML instance documents into Java content trees, and then marshalling Java content trees back into XML instance documents. It also provides a way to generate XML schema from Java objects.","JAXB"

"The body of an ___-style SOAP message is constructed in a specific way, which is defined in the SOAP standard. This is built around the assumption that you want to call the web service just like you would call a normal function or method that is part of your application code","RPC"
"Therefore, the ___ is more tightly coupled because if you make any changes in the message structure, you'll need to change all the clients and servers processing that kind of message.","RPC"

"A ________-style web service, contains no restrictions for how the SOAP body must be constructed. It allows you to include whatever XML data you want and also to include a schema for this XML.","document"

"Attaching the @________ attribute to a public method indicates that you want the method exposed as part of the web service.","WebMethod"
"The @_______ annotation is used to specify the parameter's name that needs to be exhibited in the WSDL. You should always consider using it, especially when using multiple parameters, else the WSDL will use the default argument parameter (in this case arg0), which is meaningless for web service consumers.","WebParam"
